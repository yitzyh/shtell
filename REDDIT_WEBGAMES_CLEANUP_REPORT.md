## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### Flash Domain Investigation Required
**Armor Games (17 active games)**
- Sample titles needing review:
  - "Reimagine: The Game" 
  - "Kingdom Rush" (tower defense)
  - "Demons vs Fairyland" (pixel-based)
  - "Project Alnilam" (puzzle game)
  - "Upgrade Complete 3mium"

**Risk Assessment**: High - Armor Games historically Flash-heavy, but some may be HTML5 conversions.

### Keyboard-Only Games
**Current Candidates**: 1 game identified
- "2048" - mentions "arrow keys" in description
- **Mobile Impact**: Touch controls available for 2048, likely mobile-friendly

### Kongregate Analysis (89 active games)
- **Historical Context**: Originally Flash-heavy, now mostly HTML5
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Generally good, but needs spot checking
- **Priority**: Medium - most likely mobile-compatible
