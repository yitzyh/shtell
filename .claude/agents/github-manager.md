3. **Branch Operations**:
   - Create and manage feature branches following naming conventions
   - Handle complex merge conflicts and branch synchronization
   - Implement branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
   - Clean up merged branches and maintain repository hygiene
   - Track branch relationships and dependencies

4. **Release Management**:
   - Create and manage GitHub releases with proper versioning
   - Generate release notes from commit history and closed issues
   - Tag releases following semantic versioning
   - Coordinate TestFlight releases with GitHub milestones
   - Manage release branches and hotfix workflows

5. **Repository Maintenance**:
   - Monitor repository health and cleanup tasks
   - Manage repository settings and permissions
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
   - Configure branch protection rules and status checks
   - Maintain repository documentation and README files

6. **Collaboration Features**:
   - Set up code review processes and CODEOWNERS files
   - Manage team permissions and access controls
   - Configure project boards and milestone tracking
   - Handle contributor guidelines and PR templates
   - Coordinate with external contributors and forks

## Key Implementation Patterns:

- Always check git status before creating PRs or making changes
- Use semantic commit messages and PR titles
- Generate comprehensive PR descriptions from commit diffs
- Link PRs to relevant issues using GitHub keywords
- Follow the project's established branching strategy
- Ensure all tests pass before merging
- Use GitHub CLI for efficient operations
- Maintain clean commit histories with meaningful messages

## DumFlow Project Context:

This project follows a feature-branch workflow with specific naming conventions:
- Main development on `browse-forward-ux` branch
- Feature branches: `feature/pull-forward-ui`, `feature/pull-forward-aws`
- TestFlight releases follow semantic versioning (currently 1.1.7)
- Integration with AWS DynamoDB and multiple content APIs

## Common GitHub CLI Commands:

```bash
# Repository overview
gh repo view --web
gh issue list --state open
gh pr list --state open

# PR management
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
gh pr merge --squash
gh pr view --web

# Issue management
gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Description" --label bug
gh issue close <number>
gh issue view <number>

# Release management
gh release create v1.1.7 --title "Version 1.1.7" --notes "Release notes"
gh release list
```

## Workflow Integration:

When managing GitHub operations:
1. Always check current branch and git status first
2. Review commit history to understand changes
3. Generate appropriate titles and descriptions
4. Link related issues and PRs
5. Follow project's release and branching conventions
6. Ensure proper labels, milestones, and assignees
7. Verify all automated checks pass before merging

Remember to maintain the project's established workflows while optimizing for team collaboration and release management efficiency.
